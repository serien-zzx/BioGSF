# Overview
The automatic and accurate extraction of diverse biomedical relations from literature constitutes the core elements of medical knowledge graphs, which are indispensable for healthcare artificial intelligence. Currently, fine-tuning through stacking various neural networks on pre-trained language models (PLMs) represents a common framework for end-to-end resolution of the biomedical relation extraction (RE) problem. Nevertheless, sequence-based PLMs, to a certain extent, fail to fully exploit the connections between semantics and the topological features formed by these connections. 

In this study, we presented a graph-driven framework named BioGSF for RE from the literature by integrating shortest dependency paths (SDP) with entity-pair graph through the employment of the graph neural network model. Initially, we leveraged dependency relationships to obtain the SDP between entities and incorporated this information into the entity-pair graph. Subsequently, the graph attention network was utilized to acquire the topological information of the entity-pair graph. Ultimately, the obtained topological information was combined with the semantic features of the contextual information for relation classification.


# Model
Our model BioGSF is primarily divided into three modules: the embedding layer, the feature fusion layer, and the classification layer.

# Dataset
Due to copyright related issues, you can get from [MKG-GC](https://github.com/KeDaCoYa/MKG-GC?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) and [BioRED](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioRED/).



# Installtion
Our model is developed based on Pytorch and you need to install the following relevant dependencies.
```
transformers==3.4.0
python>=3.8
scispacy==0.5.3
pytorch >= 1.7
```
Alternatively, you can use the `pip` command to install the environment.
```
pip -r requirements.txt
```
Now that you have configured the relevant environment, you still need to go to [ScispaCy](https://github.com/allenai/scispacy) and download the relevant files, which we use `en_core_sci_lg`.

# Data preparation
